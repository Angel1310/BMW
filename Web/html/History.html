              BMW AG originated with three other manufacturing companies,<br>
              Rapp Motorenwerke and Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFw) in Bavaria,<br>
              and Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach in Thuringia. The company<br>
              is now known as BMW or Bayerische Motoren Werke. Aircraft<br>
              engine manufacturer Rapp Motorenwerke became Bayerische Motorenwerke<br>
              in 1916. The engine manufacturer, which built proprietary<br>
              industrial engines after World War I, was then bought by the<br>
              owner of BFw who then merged BFw into BMW and moved the engine<br>
              works onto BFw's premises. BFw's motorcycle sideline was improved<br>
              upon by BMW and became an integral part of their business.<br>
              BMW Museum souvenirsr<br>
              The initial products were exhibited in 1922 in Munich plant.<br>
              These souvenirs were not intended for sale. It was resulted<br>
               with the historical exhibition which was organized in 1966.<br>
               BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1929 when it purchased<br>
               Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens<br>
               under licence under the Dixi marque.
